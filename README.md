# ML Regression Project

This project implements machine learning regression techniques to predict a target variable based on input features. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to build a regression model using machine learning algorithms to predict a target variable. The pipeline includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training using algorithms like Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²)
- Visualizations to compare predicted vs true values

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Regression.git
   cd ML-Regression
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:  
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the regression model and evaluate it, run the following command:

```bash
python model.py
```

To visualize the model's predictions, run:

```bash
python visualization.py
```
